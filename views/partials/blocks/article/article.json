It contains many different, sometimes useful, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/tags\/\">HTML5 tags<\/a>. Of course there are classics like <em>emphasis<\/em>, <strong>strong<\/strong>, and <small>small<\/small> but there are many others as well. Hover the following text for abbreviation tag: <abbr title=\"abbreviation\">abbr<\/abbr>. Similarly, you can use acronym tag like this: <acronym title=\"For The Win\">ftw<\/acronym>. You can define <del>deleted text<\/del> which often gets replaced with <ins>inserted<\/ins> text.<\/p><p>You can also use <kbd>keyboard text<\/kbd>, which sometimes is styled similarly to the <code>&lt;code&gt;<\/code> or <samp>samp<\/samp> tags. Even more specifically, there is a tag just for <var>variables<\/var>. Not to be mistaken with blockquotes below, the quote tag lets you denote something as <q>quoted text<\/q>. Lastly don't forget the sub (H<sub>2<\/sub>O) and sup (E=MC<sup>2<\/sup>) tags. <\/p>"
